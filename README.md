Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a game development company tha created the game Draw It or Lose It. They had contacted CTS in order to create a web based game hosting service that would allow Draw It or Lose It to run on several different operating systems and mobile phones as well. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I did a good job breaking down the overall benefits and flaws of the different operating systems and offering a balanced assessment of their overall viability for our particular use case. I went through every individual operating system in detail and researched what exaclty would be needed to run our game on those platforms and also detailed how they would affect cost and development time. Using this data I was able to create a comprehensive picture of what we need to start thinking about when we begin developing. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It provided a general framework for what I needed to consider as I was writing the code. It helped create a general idea of what would be needed for each platform and I was able to gain insight into the various functions of each platform and the obstacles I would face for using each of them.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I wish I had more room to discuss the details associated with cost and development for each of the platforms and the benefits they offered. I feel that we only had a little space to discuss each one in the design document and there was a lot more to say. I would improve it by going into more details about the programming languages required for each platform as well as the features.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I tried to interpret them as literally as possible so that there would be some consistency to the program. I tried not to add something that was not in the user requirements even if I thought it would be useful because it would be harder to take out later if it did not work out. It's extremely important to consider the user's needs since they will be the ones who are using the software. Without considering their needs it can lead to less engagement and usage and eventually the users will no longer want your software.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The main way that I approached the software was to streamline the whole process by first researching what would be needed for each platform and then implementing only what was required without trying to improvise too much. I think when working with clients its important to understand that what you want and what the client wants can be different and it is best to just focus on finding the most efficient way to satisfy the clients demands without trying to put in too much unecessary input. One strategy that I will definitely use is researching specific platforms and their programming languages so I know how to program efficiently on different systems.
